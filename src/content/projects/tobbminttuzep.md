## My Role & Objectives

On the website, I played a key role in crafting user experience and functionality. I focused on building the homepage to
showcase articles and implemented an interactive map displaying retailers across Hungary. My primary goals were:

- **A Compelling First Impression:** My primary objective was to design and develop the homepage, ensuring a visually
  appealing and intuitive layout with a seamless user journey for exploring content.
- **Performance Optimization:** I was tasked with optimizing the website's performance for a smooth user
  experience, including efficient coding practices to ensure fast loading times. Additionally, I focused on optimizing
  the interactive map functionality for minimal impact on overall website performance.

## Process & Solutions

- **Content Management Made Easy:** Recognizing the need for ongoing content updates, the website is built on WordPress,
  empowering the Több Mint Tüzép team to effortlessly manage and update their content.
- **Custom Tailored Design & Performance:** To achieve the desired level of flexibility and performance, the website is
  built on a custom theme from the ground up.
- **Utility-First Development:** Tailwind CSS streamlined the development process, ensuring a responsive and visually
  engaging design.
- **Conquering the Map Challenge:** A key feature was showcasing retailers across Hungary on an interactive map. I
  implemented the Mapbox GL JS API, enabling real-time updates by cleverly connecting retailer data stored within the
  WordPress admin panel to the map itself.

accessible to users, it's on an exciting journey of continuous content creation and feature development.

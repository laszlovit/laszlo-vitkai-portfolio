## Introduction

Looking back on my first few projects reveals just how far I've come. This case study explores the missteps and the
triumphs that ultimately shaped the way I approach development today. Let's dive into the wild world of my early
projects.

## My First Client Project: A Roller coaster of Chaos and Triumph

This early project involved developing a website for a gymnastics association dedicated to helping young athletes in the
NYTSE program take their skills to the next level. The website serves as a platform for news, training schedules, a
gallery, a blog, and contact information.

### The Mistakes

- Each element had its own ID-based style, making the whole thing a mess.
- Let's just say resizing the browser window was an adventure, thanks to all those pixel-based values.

### What I learned

I learned a lot about the importance of clean, maintainable code. After this experience, I was all about creating
reusable classes and components. It saved me tons of headaches in future projects.

## Early Web Development Experience: Exploring Solutions for Small Businesses

Before diving into more complex projects like Marketing Puzzle or Több Mint Tüzép, I honed my skills by working on
websites for smaller businesses: CsempePiramis specializing in tiles and related materials, and Pillér Építőanyag
Kereskedés focusing on building materials.

The goal was to create a strong online presence for these companies, showcasing their product categories and ranges
through a modern and user-friendly design. Additionally, by including well-functioning features like contact forms and
SEO-optimized content, I ensured potential customers could easily find and connect with the businesses.

- **Learning from limitations:** While both provided valuable learning experiences, these projects also highlighted the
  limitations of visual no-code builders. These platforms often generate bulky code structures with unnecessary
  elements, leading to "code bloat." This bloatware can significantly slow down website loading times. Even after
  optimization efforts, no-code platforms often lack the flexibility for further performance optimization
- **Understanding the value of visual builders:** However, this experience wasn't without its merits. Working with page
  builders instilled in me an understanding for their role in web development, particularly for smaller companies. These
  platforms offer a cost-effective solution for businesses with limited budgets. The user-friendly interface empowers
  them to establish a web presence without the complexities and cost of custom coding.

In essence, these early projects highlighted the importance of understanding the trade-offs between user-friendliness
and performance optimization. While no-code builders simplify website creation, they can come at the expense of code
efficiency. This experience equipped me with a valuable perspective, allowing me to approach future projects with a
focus on creating both user-friendly and high-performing websites.

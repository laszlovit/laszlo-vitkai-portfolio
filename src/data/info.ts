    about: `My coding journey started in high school, building websites for small businesses. While no-code tools got me started, I quickly hit their limits. Bloated code, slow websites – I wanted better. That sparked my passion for real coding, letting me customize and create unique features. Today, I'm in a web development bachelor's program, honing my skills with JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.  I'm always expanding my toolbox, currently diving into TypeScript and the Vue framework. I'm passionate about building lightning-fast, SEO-optimized, accessible websites.
